1,"Richmond Beach was my spiritual hangout in my childhood. It is a rocky beach in the city of Richmond Beach, which can be accessed by a long downhill drive (by car or bicycle) from the city of Edmonds. Or, as I did often, took the 30-minute walk from my house to the calm waters through a tranquil stroll through the woods of Woodway. It used to be a place inhabited by Native Americans, but now it is occupied by mostly Caucasian people. However, a totem pole stands in tribute to the tribes that used to call the beach home. It has a vast property, with a beach, a playground, two upper lawns for the view and recreation, myriad “secret” trails along the clay hillsides, picnic areas, and a square where people can walk around, take an outdoor rinse-shower after a swim, and benches for the spectacular view."
2,"Upon reflection of the ideal social moral code, within one sentence, it would be: be constructive, not destructive. We have many holy books, manuals on living, and self-help tomes. However, I feel this is the most exacting moral code in terms of a social context. By social context, I mean how we interact with others and behave in social situations. Though “be constructive, not destructive” sounds sensible, there are many nuances. Sometimes it is difficult to determine if an act is exactly constructive or destructive. In the following paragraphs, these nuances will be discussed in detail."
3,"We often think of ourselves as our body, mind, and emotions. We take these three elements and make an amalgamation. However, we also often talk about a person’s soul. Is there any scientific basis for the soul? Surprisingly, there is. Each unique personality a person has (even in circumstances of amnesia and other illnesses), the feeling and identity of the self beyond age (especially experienced as we grow older), and our inevitable subjective experience as an individual comprise a scientific foundation for the soul."
4,"The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is perhaps the most popular set of novels of the modern era. With seven books and many blockbuster films to its name, the series has amassed about 15 billion dollars in sales. How did this phenomenon become what it is? For those scratching their heads, the reason can be broken down into several areas: Rowling garnered a generous initial contract for her book, separate book covers were created for both teens and adults, midnight releases/promotions/pre-orders made the public more fanatic about the series, and fan blogs were rampant. In fact, these are just a few of the main reasons why the Harry Potter took off the way it did."
5,"Having stretch marks can lower the self esteem of people. It is often seen as something ugly, or at least unaesthetic. That is why countless people type in “how to get rid of stretch marks” in internet search engines to discover how to solve this issue. In this essay, we will focus on practical ways of making stretch marks disappear by various methods: consuming more Vitamin A, using a sugar scrub, employing aloe vera, taking hyaluronic acid through capsules, and applying coconut oil."
6,"Jesus Christ is one of the most popular figures of history and religion. Though the historical evidence of him living is not so substantial, there is enough data to claim he was a real person. However, with his existence assured by information outside the Bible, there are still many mysteries about him. One such conundrum is when he was born. In fact, “when was Jesus born” is a top search on the internet. There are many theories about when he was born in terms of the year and month, and even day. These theories have been clouded by popular myths, cultural norms, and a lack of concrete evidence. However, this essay will delve into the various theories behind his birthdate and try to get to the bottom of the question."
